1. There are 5280 feet in a mile. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the number of feet in 13 miles.

Solution: print 13 * 5280

2. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the number of seconds in 7 hours, 21 minutes and 37 seconds.

Solution: print (7 * 60 + 21) * 60 + 37 

3. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2w + 2h, where w and h are the lengths of its sides. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the length in inches of the perimeter of a rectangle with sides of length 4 and 7 inches.

Solution: print 2 * 4 + 2 * 7

4. The area of a rectangle is wh, where w and h are the lengths of its sides. Note that the multiplication operation is not shown explicitly in this formula. This is standard practice in mathematics, but not in programming. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a rectangle with sides of length 4 and 7 inches.

Solution: print 4 * 7

5. The circumference of a circle is 2πr where r is the radius of the circle. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the circumference in inches of a circle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant pi = 3.14.

Solution: print 2 * 3.14 * 8

6. The area of a circle is πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. (The raised 2 in the formula is an exponent.) Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a circle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π=3.14.

Solution: print 3.14 * 8 ** 2
