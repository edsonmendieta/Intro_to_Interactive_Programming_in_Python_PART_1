1. Given a template that pre-defines a variable miles, write an assignment statement that defines a variable feet whose value is the number of feet in \color{red}{\verb|miles|}miles miles.

Solution: feet = miles * 5280

2. Given a template that pre-defines three variables hours, minutes and seconds, write an assignment statement that updates the variable total_seconds to have a value corresponding to the total number of seconds for hours hours, minutes minutes and seconds seconds.

Solution: total_seconds = hours * 60 ** 2 + minutes * 60 + seconds

3. Given a template that pre-defines the variables width and height that are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable perimeter whose value is the perimeter of the rectangle in inches.

Solution: perimeter = width * 2 + height * 2

4. Given a template that pre-defines the variables width and height that are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable area whose value is the area of the rectangle in square inches.

Solution: area = width * height

5. Given a template that pre-defines the constant PI and the variable radius corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable circumference whose value is the circumference of a circle with radius radius in inches.

Solution: circumference = 2 * PI * radius

6. Given a template that pre-defines the constant PI and the variable radius corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable area whose value is the area of a circle with radius radius in square inches.

Solution: area = PI * radius ** 2

7. Given the pre-defined variables present_value, annual_rate and years, write an assignment statement that define a variable future_value whose value is present_value dollars invested at annual_rate percent interest, compounded annually for years years.

Solution: future_value = present_value * (1 + 0.01 * annual_rate) ** years

8. Give the pre-defined variables first_name and last_name, write an assignment statement that defines the variable name_tag whose value is the string "My name is % %." where the percents should be replaced by first_name and last_name.

Solution: name_tag = "My name is " + first_name + " " + last_name + "."

9. Given the pre-defined variables name (a string) and age (a number), write an assignment statement that defines a variable statement whose value is the string "% is % years old." where the percents should be replaced by name and the string form of age.

Solution: statement = name + " is " + str(age) + " years old."

10. Given the variables x0, y0, x1, and y1, write an assignment statement that defines a variable distance whose values is the distance between the points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1).

Solution: distance = ((x0 - x1) ** 2 + (y0 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5

11. Challenge: Heron's formula states the area of a triangle is (s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c))^0.5 where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle and s=12(a+b+c) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. Given the variables x0, y0, x1,y1, x2, and y2, write a Python program that computes a variable area whose value is the area of the triangle with vertices (x0,y0), (x1,y1), and (x2,y2).

Solution: 

side1 = ((x0 - x1) ** 2 + (y0 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5
side2 = ((x0 - x2) ** 2 + (y0 - y2) ** 2) ** 0.5
side3 = ((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2) ** 0.5

semi_perimeter = 0.5 * (side1 + side2 + side3)

area =  (semi_perimeter * (semi_perimeter - side1) * (semi_perimeter - side2) * (semi_perimeter - side3)) ** 0.5
