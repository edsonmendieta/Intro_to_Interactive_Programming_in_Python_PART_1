1. Given a template that pre-defines a variable miles, write an assignment statement that defines a variable feet whose value is the number of feet in \color{red}{\verb|miles|}miles miles.

Solution: feet = miles * 5280

2. Given a template that pre-defines three variables hours, minutes and seconds, write an assignment statement that updates the variable total_seconds to have a value corresponding to the total number of seconds for hours hours, minutes minutes and seconds seconds.

Solution: total_seconds = hours * 60 ** 2 + minutes * 60 + seconds

3. Given a template that pre-defines the variables width and height that are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable perimeter whose value is the perimeter of the rectangle in inches.

Solution: perimeter = width * 2 + height * 2

4. Given a template that pre-defines the variables width and height that are the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, write an assignment statement that defines a variable area whose value is the area of the rectangle in square inches.

Solution: area = width * height

5. Given a template that pre-defines the constant PI and the variable radius corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable circumference whose value is the circumference of a circle with radius radius in inches.

Solution: circumference = 2 * PI * radius

6. Given a template that pre-defines the constant PI and the variable radius corresponding to the radius of a circle in inches, write an assignment statement that defines a variable area whose value is the area of a circle with radius radius in square inches.

Solution: area = PI * radius ** 2
